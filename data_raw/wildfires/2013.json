Fire personnel will continue to mop up hot spots in the difficult and dangerous terrain for several days until control of the fire is attained. Because of this we ask those driving in the area to remain vigilant and drive slowly and safely because of the heavy fire resource traffic on the narrow roads. If an emergency develops around a residence within the fire area call 911 and fire resources will be directed to that incident. http://www.readyforwildfire.org/","Counties":["Butte"],"CountyIds":"4","SearchDescription":"The Centerville Fire burned August 2013 off of Centerville Road in the Butte Creek Canyon in the community of Centerville, west of Magalia, in Butte County.","SearchKeywords":"Centerville Fire, August 2013, September 2013, Butte County, Centerville Road, Butte Creek Canyon, Centerville, Magalia","AdminUnit":"CAL FIRE Butte Unit","Updated":"2013-09-01T18:00:00Z","Started":"2013-08-31T17:23:00Z","Extinguished":"2013-09-01T18:00:00Z","ArchiveYear":2013,"Public":true,"Active":false,"Featured":false,"CalFireIncident":true,"MajorIncident":true,"Final":true,"Status":"Finalized","CanonicalUrl":"/incidents/2013/8/31/centerville-fire/","StructuresDestroyed":null,"StructuresDamaged":null,"StructuresThreatened":null,"StructuresEvacuated":null,"PersonnelInvolved":35,"CrewsInvolved":2,"Injuries":1,"Fatalities":null,"Helicopters":null,"Engines":10,"Dozers":null,"WaterTenders":null,"AirTankers":null},{"UniqueId":"3513f584-632d-4fd0-a98a-646eb0753248","Name":"Butte Fire","Location":"Butte Ave near Conejo Ave near the community of Helm.","Latitude":0.0,"Longitude":0.0,"AcresBurned":80.0,"FuelType":null,"PercentContained":100.0,"ControlStatement":"","ConditionStatement":"","Counties":["Fresno"],"CountyIds":"10","SearchDescription":"The Butte Fire burned in April 2013, off Butte Ave near Conejo Ave near the community of Helm in Fresno County.","SearchKeywords":"Butte Fire, April 2013, Helm, Fresno County, Butte Ave","AdminUnit":"CAL FIRE / Fresno County Fire","Updated":"2013-04-09T15:30:00Z","Started":"2013-04-09T12:35:00Z","Extinguished":"2013-04-09T15:30:00Z","ArchiveYear":2013,"Public":true,"Active":false,"Featured":false,"CalFireIncident":true,"MajorIncident":false,"Final":true,"Status":"Finalized","CanonicalUrl":"/incidents/2013/4/9/butte-fire/","StructuresDestroyed":null,"StructuresDamaged":null,"StructuresThreatened":null,"StructuresEvacuated":null,"PersonnelInvolved":null,"CrewsInvolved":null,"Injuries":null,"Fatalities":null,"Helicopters":null,"Engines":null,"Dozers":null,"WaterTenders":null,"AirTankers":null},{"UniqueId":"ff13baa0-35e0-44dd-b994-38ada16baf7b","Name":"Tehama Fire","Location":"East of Molinos","Latitude":0.0,"Longitude":0.0,"AcresBurned":75.0,"FuelType":null,"PercentContained":100.0,"ControlStatement":"","ConditionStatement":"","Counties":["Tehama"],"CountyIds":"52","SearchDescription":"The Tehama Fire burned September 2013 east of Molinos in Tehama County.","SearchKeywords":"Tehama Fire, September 2013, Tehama County, Molinos","AdminUnit":"CAL FIRE Tehama-Glenn Unit","Updated":"2013-09-15T19:00:00Z","Started":"2013-09-15T17:39:00Z","Extinguished":"2013-09-15T19:00:00Z","ArchiveYear":2013,"Public":true,"Active":false,"Featured":false,"CalFireIncident":true,"MajorIncident":false,"Final":true,"Status":"Finalized","CanonicalUrl":"/incidents/2013/9/15/tehama-fire/","StructuresDestroyed":null,"StructuresDamaged":null,"StructuresThreatened":null,"StructuresEvacuated":null,"PersonnelInvolved":null,"CrewsInvolved":null,"Injuries":null,"Fatalities":null,"Helicopters":null,"Engines":null,"Dozers":null,"WaterTenders":null,"AirTankers":null},{"UniqueId":"ed51bbd2-6f8e-4f46-9073-3673a583fada","Name":"Silverwood Fire","Location":" Hwy 138 west of Hwy 173","Latitude":34.316,"Longitude":-117.352,"AcresBurned":75.0,"FuelType":null,"PercentContained":100.0,"ControlStatement":"","ConditionStatement":"","Counties":["San Bernardino"],"CountyIds":"36","SearchDescription":"The Silverwood Fire burned in July 2013 off Highway 138 and Highway 173 in San Bernardino County.","SearchKeywords":"Silverwood Fire, July, 2013, Highway 138, Highway 173, San Bernardino County","AdminUnit":"San Bernardino County Fire","Updated":"2013-07-26T18:15:00Z","Started":"2013-07-25T15:09:00Z","Extinguished":"2013-07-26T18:15:00Z","ArchiveYear":2013,"Public":true,"Active":false,"Featured":false,"CalFireIncident":true,"MajorIncident":false,"Final":true,"Status":"Finalized","CanonicalUrl":"/incidents/2013/7/25/silverwood-fire/","StructuresDestroyed":null,"StructuresDamaged":null,"StructuresThreatened":null,"StructuresEvacuated":null,"PersonnelInvolved":null,"CrewsInvolved":null,"Injuries":null,"Fatalities":null,"Helicopters":null,"Engines":null,"Dozers":null,"WaterTenders":null,"AirTankers":null},{"UniqueId":"7055a440-5d4c-4f58-bac9-2954ff6698a5","Name":"Revis Fire","Location":"Off Revis Road & Yosemite Springs Parkway in Yosemite Lake Parks area in Coarsegold","Latitude":37.169379,"Longitude":-119.75636,"AcresBurned":75.0,"FuelType":null,"PercentContained":100.0,"ControlStatement":"","ConditionStatement":"","Counties":["Madera"],"CountyIds":"20","SearchDescription":"The Revis Fire burned in June 2013 off Revis Road and Yosemire Springs Parkway in Yosemite Lake Parks area in Coarsegold in Madera County.
